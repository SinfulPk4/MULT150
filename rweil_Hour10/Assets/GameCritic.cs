  Improving the game!
    The game is fairly easy, knocking the balls into the goals isn't much of a challenge.
    Adding some static obsticles could make the game harder.
    Adding movement mechanics similar to rocket league to the bumper could make the game more interesting.
  The fun part of the game is seeing the balls slingshot around sometimes, not too tedious unless the ball gets stuck behind the bumper.

Changed the movement sound to the old minecraft splash noise! :)
 Improved design of bumper, changing both shape and out of many shapes.
Added floor surrounding arena and bleachers .
Created super chaos ball, glowing super fast ball that bounces off all other surfaces.

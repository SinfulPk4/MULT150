 Game Critic!!
The game is fairly easy. Difficulty wise 1/5
Changes to make it harder could be changing the severity of the obsticles or adding obsticles to duck under
Adding more movement options and sound effects can add a wow factor 
Two fun aspects are trying to get as far as possible and dodging the obsticles
The most tedious parts were the size of the obsticles and the chance of them spawning right next to a power up

I changed both pickups, the power up is an atom like sphere, and the obsticle is a ufo.
